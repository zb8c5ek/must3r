## Get Started

MUSt3R extends the DUSt3R architecture through several modifications: making it symmetric and enabling online predictions of the camera pose and 3D structure of a collection of images by using a multi-layer memory mechanism.

### Checkpoints
We provide several pre-trained models. For these checkpoints, make sure to agree to the license of all the training datasets we used, in addition to [MUSt3R License](LICENSE). For more information, check [NOTICE](NOTICE).

| Modelname   | Training resolutions | Head | Encoder | Decoder |
|-------------|----------------------|------|---------|---------|
| [`MUSt3R_224_cvpr.pth`](https://download.europe.naverlabs.com/ComputerVision/MUSt3R/MUSt3R_224_cvpr.pth) | 224x224 | Linear | ViT-L | ViT-B |
| [`MUSt3R_512_cvpr.pth`](https://download.europe.naverlabs.com/ComputerVision/MUSt3R/MUSt3R_512_cvpr.pth)   | 512x384, 512x336, 512x288, 512x256, 512x160 | Linear | ViT-L | ViT-B |
| [`MUSt3R_512.pth`](https://download.europe.naverlabs.com/ComputerVision/MUSt3R/MUSt3R_512.pth) | 512x384, 512x336, 512x288, 512x256, 512x160 | Linear | ViT-L | ViT-B |

`MUSt3R_224_cvpr` and `MUSt3R_512_cvpr` are the same checkpoints that we evaluated for CVPR.  
`MUSt3R_512` was finetuned from `MUSt3R_512_cvpr` with updated hyperparamers (20 views instead of 10, bf16, less token dropout, also see training section) and additional datasets (higher resolution version of [ARKitScenes](https://github.com/apple/ARKitScenes) from the depth upsample subset, updated [ScanNet++](https://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannetpp/) to v2, added back [Virtual Kitti 2](https://europe.naverlabs.com/proxy-virtual-worlds-vkitti-2/), some scenes from [Hypersim](https://github.com/apple/ml-hypersim), and generated scenes with [InfiniGen](https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen)). It outperforms `MUSt3R_512_cvpr` in most of the evaluations (see [the updated evaluations](assets/evals.md)).

We also provide both the trainingfree.pth and codebook.pkl files necessary to run image retrieval. `MUSt3R_512_cvpr` and `MUSt3R_512` share the same encoder so there's only one set of files for both of them.

## Demo

### Offline Gradio (+viser) Demo

By default, `demo.py` will open a gradio instance on localhost:7860. If you launch the demo with `--viser`, it will also lauch a viser instance on localhost:8080. Load the images with gradio, hit run and visualize the reconstruction as it's being made in the viser tab.

> [!NOTE]
> `demo.py` is installed as `must3r_demo` (or `must3r_demo.exe`) when must3r is installed to `site-packages`. 

```bash
python demo.py --weights /path/to/MUSt3R_512.pth --retrieval /path/to/MUSt3R_512_retrieval_trainingfree.pth --image_size 512 --viser --embed_viser

# use --amp bf16 if your gpu supports
# Use --local_network to make it accessible on the local network, or --server_name to specify the url manually
# Use --server_port to change the port, by default it will search for an available port starting at 7860
# Use --device to use a different device, by default it's "cuda"
# --allow_local_files adds a second tab to load images from a local directory
# --viser is used to launch the viser server at the same time as gradio (for real-time updates). 
# Two options:
# 1) use --embed_viser to replace the gradio "Model3D" component with the embedded viser page (recommended) 
# 2) Open a new tab and access the viser url, typically http://localhost:8080/.
# Note: only one instance of viser is launched so all clients will see the same reconstructions.
# Viser's viewer will try to target a fixed framerate and lower the quality when the framerate is low.
# To disable this behaviour, open viser with http://localhost:8080/?fixedDpr=1 (recommended)

# other examples
# 512 resolution bf16, allow local files
python demo.py --weights /path/to/MUSt3R_512.pth --retrieval /path/to/MUSt3R_512_retrieval_trainingfree.pth --image_size 512 --amp bf16 --viser --embed_viser --allow_local_files

# 224 resolution, fp16, allow local files
python3 demo.py --weights /path/to/MUSt3R_224_cvpr.pth --retrieval /path/to/MUSt3R_224_retrieval_trainingfree.pth --image_size 224 --viser --embed_viser --allow_local_files --amp fp16
# 768 resolution (will use interpolated positional embeddings)
python demo.py --weights /path/to/MUSt3R_512.pth --retrieval /path/to/MUSt3R_512_retrieval_trainingfree.pth --image_size 768 --amp bf16 --viser --embed_viser
```

> [!Note]
>  IMPORTANT: Explanation of the demo parameters

1) select images:  
     - you can upload images using the gradio.File component.
     - if you use `--allow_local_files`, a second tab will appear: `local_path`. In this tab, you can paste a directory path from your local machine and hit `load` to quickly select all the images inside this directory (not recursive).

2) select global parameters
     - "Number of refinement iterations" increase it to 1 or 2 to do multiple pass on the keyframes (useful for loop closure)  
     - "Maximum batch size" -> If you are using a small gpu or you have a lot of images, put 1 to limit the vram usage (IMPORTANT).  

3) select the inference algorithm:  
  There are 4 Modes implemented. You'll have to select the mode that is most suited to your data:  
> [!Note]
>  If your images are unordered, then you **HAVE TO** select `unordered: retrieval` (only available with the --retrieval option). 

- 3.a. for an unordered collection of images, change it to "unordered: retrieval"  
     - Select the Number of memory images (also called keyframes). For this one, I would say to put as many as possible but to not go above 300, the more images there are, the slower/more memory hungry it'll be.
     - Leave "Render once" toggled OFF. You can toggle it ON if "Number of refinement iterations" > 0. 
- 3.b. for a simple video sequence, you can select "sequence: linspace"
     - Same parameters as 3.a.
- 3.c. for a longer video sequence : "sequence: slam keyframes"  (selected by default).
     - Default parameters should be good enough. You can increase subsample to 4 for slam at higher resolutions (>= 512)
     - The online version is equivalent to "sequence: slam keyframes" with local_context=0.
- 3.d. for a longer video sequence, if the KDTree/slam is too slow for you : "sequence: local context and linspace keyframes".
    - You can also keep default parameters.

4) Hit "Run". Wait for the process the load all images and switch to the viser tab to see the reconstruction, or wait until the full reconstruction appears in gradio.

### Online Visual Odometry Demo (open3d)

> [!NOTE]
> `slam.py` is installed as `must3r_slam` (or `must3r_slam.exe`) when must3r is installed to `site-packages`. 

```bash
# examples
# slam demo from a webcam (512 model)
python slam.py --chkpt /path/to/MUSt3R_512.pth --res 512 --subsamp 4 --gui --input cam:0 

# slam demo from a directory of images (224 model)
python slam.py \
	--chkpt "/path/to/MUSt3R_224_cvpr.pth" \
	--res 224 \
	--subsamp 2 \
  --keyframe_overlap_thr 0.05 \
  --min_conf_keyframe 1.5 \
  --overlap_percentile 85 \
	--input "/path_to/TUM_RGBD/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_xyz/rgb" \  # can be a folder of video frames, or a webcam: cam:0
	--gui

# slam demo without a gui (it will write final memory state <memory.pkl> and camera trajectory <all_poses.npz>, optionally rerendered with --rerender)
python slam.py --chkpt /path/to/MUSt3R_512.pth --res 512 --subsamp 4 --input /path/to/video.mp4 --output /path/to/export
```

## Training

### Notes
The training of MUSt3R has evolved since CVPR so I'll write some notes:

- First, MUSt3R is implemented in two different classes: MUSt3R and CausalMUSt3R. MUSt3R is meant for inference and CausalMUSt3R was implemented to speed up the training. Instead of processing images 1 by 1, like at inference, CausalMUSt3R runs blocks of (5) images at once, with a causal attention mask to only attend previous images. The feeback mechanism is only applied after this.

- Two "dropout_mode" are implemented in CausalMUSt3R. "permanent" is the version used for cvpr where memory tokens are permanently removed at every step. "temporary" is the version we've been using since then where tokens are temporarily masked.

- In the dataloader, there are two parameters: min_memory_num_views and max_memory_num_views that didn't exist for the cvpr submissions. They are there to ensure that all images output by the dataloader overlap with at least one of the memory frame (== keyframe). For cvpr, it was possible to select a low number of memory frames, for example 2, and have the 10th image overlap with the 8th but not with any of the first two.

- There's no validation within train.py, you have to run it (eval.py) manually.
